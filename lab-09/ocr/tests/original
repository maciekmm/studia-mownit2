Limited as he was to the skies over Greenwich, Flamsteed was glad to see the flamboyant Edmond Halley take off for the South Atlantic in 1676, right after the founding of the Royal Observatory. Halley set up a mini-Greenwich on the island of St. Helena. It was the right place but the wrong atmosphere, and Halley counted only 341 new stars through the haze. Nevertheless, the achievement earned him a flattering reputation as "the southern Tycho."
During his own tenure as astronomer royal, from 1720 to 1742, Halley studiously tracked the moon. The mapping of the heavens, after all, was merely a prelude to the more challenging problem of charting the moon's course through the fields of stars. The moon follows an irregular elliptical orbit around the Earth, so that the moon's distance from the Earth and relation to the background stars is in constant flux. What's mroe, since the moon's orbital motion varies cyclically over an eighteen-year period, eighteen years' worth of data constitute the bare minimum groundwork for any meaningful predictions of the moon's
